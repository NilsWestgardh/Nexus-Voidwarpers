              <p>You can still defend with an entity or activate its abilities no matter how long it’s been on the battlezone. Machine entities are both machines and entities. They’re usually colorless like most machines, and they can attack and defend like other entities.</p>

              <p>In Nexus, voidwarpers are powerful allies who can fight by your side. Voidwarpers can only be played any time you could play a sequence. They’re permanents, and each voidwarper enters the battlezone with the number of alliance counters indicated on the bottom right of the card. Each voidwarper has alliance abilities that can be activated by adding or removing alliance counters from the voidwarper.</p>
              <p>For example, the symbol (+1) means “Put one alliance counter on this voidwarper” and the symbol (-3) means “Remove three alliance counters from this voidwarper.” You can activate an alliance ability only any time you could play a sequence and only if none of that voidwarper’s alliance abilities has been activated yet that turn.</p>
              <p>Voidwarpers can be attacked by their owner's opponent’s entities (entities that do, can still be defended as normal), and your opponent can damage them with scripts and abilities instead of damaging you. Any damage dealt to a voidwarper causes it to lose that many alliance counters. If a voidwarper has no loyalty counters, it’s put into your cache.</p>
              <p>Voidwarpers always have the Mythical supertype and a subtype that is the voidwarper's first name, following this formatting: Mythical Voidwarper — [First Name]. So a voidwarper card like Vega, Mechanic Manipulator would have the type line: Mythical Voidwarper — Vega.</p>

You can only do this once during one of the main phases of each of your own turns. This happens immediately so no player can do anything in response.</p>
              <p>Most sources have abilities that produce energy. This is why sources are used to produce energy which you need to pay the cost for cards or abilities.</p>

No one can look at the cards in your deck, but you may know how many cards are currently in each player’s deck. Each player has their own deck.

Entities, machines, enhancements, and voidwarpers enter the battlezone after they resolve from the stack. Your cards in the battlezone may be arranged in any way you like but must be visible at all times to your opponent, and it must be obvious whether or not a card is tapped.

Entities are put in the cache if the damage they’re dealt in a single turn is equal to or greater than their defense, or if their defense is reduced to 0 or less.

            <p>To make progress in Nexus, you must make energy. It is used to pay for the costs of cards. Energy comes in different colors, either one of the colors of cards in the game or colorless. When a specific color is needed to pay a cost, you’ll see a symbol indicating which color. (Y) for yellow, (B) for blue, (P) for purple, (R) for red, (G) for green, and (C) for colorless. When any kind of energy can be used, you’ll see a number like (2)</p>
            <p>Energy is produced by sources. Base sources have a large energy symbol on them. You can tap a base source to produce one energy of that color and add it to your energy pool (it is where your energy is available and stored until it's spent or until the turn ends).</p>
            <p>Other sources and some entities, machines, and scripts can also produce energy. If they can, it will say something like “Add (Y) to your energy pool.”</p>

            <h3 id="section2.2">Warping</h3>
            <p>A unique feature of Nexus: Voidwarpers is variable base energy. Once during each match, each player may turn only one base energy card in their hand into any other base energy type. This is called Warping, and it helps players avoid situations where they play a deck with multiple colors but don’t draw sufficient amounts of a specific base source.</p>
            <p>For example, a player holds a card that costs (1)(Y)(B) but only has one radiant source, and two chemical sources. They then draw another radiant source, not the electric source they need to play the card. They can then use</p>

            <p>You tap a permanent when you use a source to produce energy, when you attack with an entity, or when you activate an ability that has (T) as part of its cost (which means “tap this permanent”). Tapped cards are turned sideways.</p>
            <p>When a permanent is tapped, it typically means it's been used for that turn, and you can’t tap it again until it's untapped (returned to its original straightened-out position).</p>
            <p>At the beginning of each player’s turn, they untap their tapped cards, making them available to use again.</p>

          <div class="row my-4 ">
            <h2 id="section2.4">Scripts</h2>
            <p>All cards except sources are played as scripts. Sequences, entities, machines, enhancements, and voidwarpers can only be played during a player’s main phase if there are no unresolved scripts on the stack. Interrupts can be played at any time. Most activated abilities or permanents can be activated at any time you could play an interrupt.</p>
          </div>
  
          <!-- Playing a Script -->
          <div class="row p-3 my-4 section-sub">
            <h3>Playing a Script</h3>
            <p>When you play a script, it goes on the stack. If the script is a sequence or interrupt which says “Choose one —” you choose which option you’re using. If the script is a sequence or interrupt that has a target, you choose what the target of that script is. Augmentations scripts also target the permanent they augment. If the script has (X) in its cost, you choose what number of energy X stands for, then pay the total cost of the script (including X).</p>
          </div>
  
          <!-- Target -->
          <div class="row p-3 my-4 section-sub">
            <h3>Target</h3>
            <p>When you see the word “target” on a script or ability, you have to choose one or more targets for the script or ability to affect. That can be a permanent, players, cards in a cache or archive. The kinds of targets will be indicated by the card. You choose the targets for a script when you play it, and you choose targets for an activated ability when you activate it. If you can’t meet the targeting requirements, you can’t play the script or activate the activated ability.</p>
            <p>When the script or ability resolves, it checks the targets to make sure they are legal. If a target isn’t legal, the script or ability can’t affect it. If none of the targets are legal, the script or ability is countered and has no effect.</p>
          </div>
  
          <!-- Responding to a Script -->
          <div class="row p-3 my-4 section-sub">
            <h3>Responding to a Script</h3>
            <p>The script doesn’t resolve (have its effect) right away – it goes on the stack first. Each player is then able to play an interrupt or activate an activated ability in response. If any player (including you) does, that interrupt or ability goes on the stack as well but is now first in order waiting to be resolved. When all players decline to do anything in response, the last script or ability added to the stack is resolved.</p>
          </div>
  
          <!-- Resolving a Script -->
          <div class="row p-3 my-4 section-sub">
            <h3>Resolving a Script</h3>
            <p>When a script resolves, if it's an interrupt or sequence, it has its effect (follow and execute the instructions on the card), then put the card into your cache. If the script is permanent, it goes in the battlezone.</p>
            <p>After the script resolves, players can decide to play scripts or activate activated abilities again. If no one does, the next thing on the stack resolves. If the stack is empty, the current phase of the turn ends, and the game proceeds to the next phase. If a player plays a script or activates an activated ability again, it goes on the top of the stack and the process repeats.</p>

              <li>You and your opponent decline to do anything else. {cardname} resolves first, making Captain Meira a 5/4 until the end of the turn.</li>
              <li>Then Zap resolves, dealing 2 damage to Captain Meira, which is no longer enough to kill it.</li>

            <p>Zap goes on the stack before {cardname} so it resolves first. It deals 2 damage to Captain Meira, which is enough to kill it since it is still a 2/1. When {cardname} tries to resolve its target is no longer valid since Captain Meira is no longer in the battlezone, so {cardname} is countered and has no effect, then goes to the cache.</p>

            <h3>Static Abilities</h3>
            <p>Static abilities are any text that remains true while the permanent is in the battlezone. For example, {cardname} is an Enhancement with the ability “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.” It’s never activated and just has its stated effect while it remains in the battlezone.</p>

          <div class="row p-3 my-4 section-sub">
            <h3>Triggered Abilities</h3>
            <p>Triggered abilities are the text that is executed immediately when an event causes specific criteria to be met. For example, {cardname} is an entity with the ability “When {cardname} dies, draw a card.”</p>
            <p>Each triggered ability starts with “when”, “whenever”, or “at”. Triggered abilities, like static abilities, cannot be activated. The ability goes on the stack and resolves, like a script. The ability still resolves, even if the source of the ability leaves the battlezone while the ability is on the stack. If a triggered ability requires a target, but no legal target exists, the ability doesn’t happen.</p>
          </div>
    
          <div class="row p-3 my-4 section-sub">
            <h3>Activated Abilities</h3>
            <p>Activated abilities can be activated at any time, barring it has no stated restriction, as long as you can pay its activation cost. Activation costs are not limited to energy only. For example, {cardname} is an entity with the ability “Sacrifice another entity: Put a +1/+1 counter on {cardname}.”</p>
            <p>Each activated ability has a cost, then a colon (”:”), followed by its effect. Some activated abilities have the {T} symbol in their costs, meaning you must tap the permanent to activate the ability. Therefore, if the permanent is already tapped, you can’t activate the ability.</p>
            <p>When you activate an activated ability it goes on the stack and resolves like a script. Like with triggered abilities, if the source of the activated ability leaves the battlezone when the ability is on the stack, it still resolves.</p>

          <div class="row p-3 my-4 section-sub">
            <h3>Keywords</h3>
            <p>Keywords are common abilities that have a single word as a shorthand. Keywords have explainer text which describes their ability’s effect. Most keywords are static abilities, but can also be triggered or activated abilities. Core keywords are keywords that are most common, appearing in almost every set. They include; deploy, encrypt, firewall, flash, flight, immune, indestructible, intercept, leech, overpower, quickstrike, rapid, steadfast, threat, and virus.

            <h3>Win or Lose Effects</h3>
            <p>Some cards will literally say that a player will win the game or lose the game. These effects are rare, and will either; come at a high price (either in its cost, or the punishment if it fails), or only be enabled once very specific criteria are met.</p>
            <p>For example, {cardname} is a sequence with the text “Take an extra turn after this one. At the beginning of that turn’s end step, you lose the game.” It’s a powerful effect, that comes with a serious downside.</p>
            <p>{cardname} is an enhancement with the text “At the beginning of your upkeep, if X, Y, and Z, you win the game”. Also a powerful effect, contingent on many conditions being met.</p>

            <h2 id="section2.8">Attacking and Defending</h2>
            <p>As stated the primary way to win is to attack with entities. When an entity attacks a player and is not defended, it deals damage equal to its attack to that player.</p>
            <p>The combat phase happens in the middle of players’ turns. The combat phase starts with the player whose turn it is first selecting which of their entities will attack, and then selecting who or what those entities attack. Each entity’s attack target is selected independently, meaning they don’t all have to attack the same target in a given turn. They can attack opposing players or one of their voidwalkers. They cannot however attack enemy entities. Each entity that is selected to attack becomes tapped after attackers are selected. Then all attacking entities attack at the same time. You can only attack with entities that are untapped before selecting attackers, and only if it was already in the battlezone when your turn began.</p>
            <p>Then the player being attacked selects which of their entities will defend. Only untapped entities can be selected as a defender. All entities can defend no matter how long they have been in the battlezone. Each entity can defend only one attacker, but each attacker can be defended by multiple entities at the same time. When that happens, the attacking player chooses the order in which defending entity will receive damage from the attacking entity first. Entities do not have to defend attacking entities.</p>
            <p>After all defending entities are selected, combat damage is assigned, then dealt. Each entity – both attackers and defenders – deal damage equal to their attack. When combat damage is assigned:</p>
            <ul class="custom-ul">
              <li>Attacking entities that were not defended assigns damage to the player or voidwarper it’s attacking.</li>
              <li>Attacking entities that were defended deals damage to the defending entity. If the attacking entity is defended by multiple entities, the attacking player decides on how to distribute the attacking entity’s damage. The first defending entity in line must be assigned at least enough damage to destroy it before any other damage can be assigned to the next defending entity, and so on until all damage the attacking entity could deal has been assigned.</li>
              <li>Blocking entities assigns damage to the attacker it’s defending.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When combat damage is dealt:</p>
            <ul class="custom-ul">
              <li>Damage assigned to the defending player makes them lose that much life.</li>
              <li>Damage assigned to the defending player’s voidwarpers makes them lose that many allegiance counters.</li>
              <li>
                Damage assigned to both players’ entities is dealt.
                <ul>
                  <li>If the damage received is equal to or greater than the entity’s defense in a single turn, that entity is destroyed.</li>
                  <li>If the damage received is not equal to or greater than the entity’s defense in a single turn, that entity is not destroyed. However, the damage remains until the end of the turn, before wearing off.</li>

              <h3>Select Attackers</h3>
              <p>The attacking player attacks their three biggest entities and taps them. They don’t attack with the smallest because they would be too easy for a defender to destroy. And it might come in handy as a defender if the opponent attacks on their turn. A 1/1 can still defend and absorb all the damage from a much bigger entity that would otherwise damage the player.</p>

              <h3>Select Defenders</h3>

            <h2 id="section2.10">The Override Rule</h2>
            <p>If a Nexus card contradicts the rules of the game, the card is correct. This makes the rules of Nexus a flexible framework that supports a vast amount of unique interactions and a range of strategies. For example, the rules say that you can attack with any number of entities during a turn. But {cardname} is an entity that says “No more than one entity can attack each combat.” While {cardname} is in the battlezone, its static ability changes the rule of the game.</p>

          <div class="row p-3 my-4 section-sub">
            <h3>Start the Game</h3>
            <p>Each player starts the game with 20 health, and at least 60 cards in their deck. Which player goes first is decided at random, unless this is the second or third match in a best-of-three game. In which case the losing player of the previous match in the series decides who goes first.</p>
            <p>Each player shuffles their deck, then draws a starting hand of exactly seven cards. Both players then decide if they want to keep the hand they drew. If they don’t, they can mulligan. The player who starts the match decides first, and then the other player decides if they also want to mulligan.</p>
            <p>To mulligan, shuffle your starting hand into your deck, then draw seven new cards and put one of them at the bottom of your deck (you don’t have to reveal the card to your opponent). Then the process repeats, until no player mulligans. Each time a player mulligans, they must put an additional card of their new hand on the bottom of their deck. So, for the first mulligan, they return one card. Then two cards for their second mulligan, three cards for their third, and so on.</p>
            <p>When both players decide to keep their starting hand, the game starts, and the starting player goes first.</p>

            <h3 id="section3.2">Parts of the Turn</h3>
            <p>Each turn of the game is split into phases, that in turn are split into steps. Each turn moves between these phases and steps in the same order. Whenever a new phase or step is entered, any triggered abilities that happen during that phase or step go on the stack. The active player, meaning the player whose turn it is, has priority over the other player. That means they get to play scripts or activate abilities before their opponent. When both players subsequently decide not to act and nothing on the stack is waiting to be resolved, the game proceeds to the next step or phase.</p>
            <p>Below is a description of each of the phases and steps in the order they happen during a turn. They are described from the active player’s perspective.</p>

          <div class="row p-3 my-4 section-sub">
            <h3>Building Your Deck</h3>
            <p>In Nexus each player plays with their own customized deck. Decks are built using any cards players want. When it comes to deckbuilding, most of it is up to you, which offers each player a lot of freedom to create their deck. But there are a few rules regarding decks:</p>
            <ul class="custom-ul">
              <li>A deck must have at least 60 cards.</li>
              <li>A deck cannot have more than 4 copies of any given card <i>(except base sources).</i></li>
              <li>A deck can only be paired with one power at a time.</li>
              <li>A deck’s sideboard cannot have more than 15 cards.</li>
              <li>All cards in a deck and that deck’s sideboard must be legal in the format it’s intended for.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here’s some general guidelines for building a deck:</p>
            <ul class="custom-ul">
              <li><b>Sources</b> — A good rule of thumb is that 40-45% of your deck should be sources. The amount depends on the cost curve of your cards. Decks with lower-cost cards need fewer sources, and decks with higher-cost cards need more sources. Generally, decks have between 24-28 sources.</li>
              <li><b>Entities</b> — A good rule of thumb is that 25-40% of your deck should be entities. Depending on your decks strategy the cost of entities will vary, but a mix of energy costs gives you more flexibility throughout a match. You’ll have both early- and late-game threats.</li>
              <li><b>Other cards</b> — Round out your deck with machines, enhancements, voidwarpers, interrupts, and sequences.</li>
              <li><b>Sideboard</b> — Sideboards let players customize their deck between matches in best-of-three games. Typically a good sideboard contains a variety of cards that are useful against specific types of cards and strategies your opponents may have. Since you don’t know what they’ll be playing before the match starts, its good to prepare for as many likely scenarios as possible.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As you play your deck, you may start to notice some cards that are more or less impactful or combinations of cards that work well. You can always customize your deck between games to improve it or adjust it depending on trends in the competition you’re facing.</p>
            <p>As players collect more cards they’ll have more options to customize their deck or build new ones. Player’s will build different decks for different formats.</p>

          <div class="row my-4 ">
            <h2 id="section4.2">Formats</h2>
            <p>Formats are defined by what cards are legal to play in them. This is often dictated by what card sets are available. Formats change over time, allowing for new strategies to emerge, as sets rotate in and out. Set rotations happen when a new set is released. In Standard, only cards from the most recent sets are allowed. When a new set is released, the oldest set in Standard rotates in, and the new set rotates in, updating the legal sets in Standard.</p>
            <p>At launch, Standard will be the only game format available. Other formats include the Playground, and Chaos.</p>
